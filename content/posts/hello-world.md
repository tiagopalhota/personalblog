# **Hi ðŸ‘‹ there!**

I guess this is it. I finally got a blog up and running.

IÂ´ve been told many times that blog helps our mind and the most important thing is to do it for ourselves, not others. This has been a massive issue for me because the web is full of great posts by great minds and I always thought I hadnÂ´t anything else to contribute. ðŸ˜•

The problem in this mindset is that I was thinking about others, not myself. This blog needs to be something to help myself, write down the things I learn, revisit them when I need and if it happens to help someone else, great, but that is not really the main focus.

I will try to put down my journey into the Microsoft Azure Cloud Administration and the challenges I face whilst creating data pipelines.
