# **Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ IÂ´m Tiago**

IÂ´ve been working with all data things related since 2008. I got started in IT by tinkering with PHP and MYSQL, creating websites and making some side money whilst studying. From there, I got my first job working as a Business Intelligence Developer and getting familiar with Microsoft SQL Server from the data model , to ETL and then reporting with Reporting Services.

Being responsible for the entire pipeline exposed me to very interesting challenges and a lot of sleepless nights. But there was a "small" problem... everything just seemed to go very slow!

ThatÂ´s what brought my attention to SQL Server internals and how the engine really works and 'thinks' behind the scenes. Since then, my career has been really focused on the Database Administration side of things and I have been very happy with it.

## **Automate all the things!**

My data journey has given me the opportunity to be part of a lot of social events,where I've met brilliant minds and have learned a lot from them..
One of the biggest interests I took from these events, is the need for automation. Automate everything you can, make things reliable and repeatable.
Powershell has then been really important to me as I get to automate repeatable tasks and saving myself and customers, many many hours.

## **Database and Devops**

From the moment I started getting comfortable with Powershell, the next obvious step was to start getting my feet wet into Devops Practices. I had the opportunity to work with other engineers to introduce database unit testing and create and maintain CI/CD pipelines.

## **What am I up to now**

Cloud time! IÂ´m very happy to be back working for AIFS UK with a mixed role of Database Administration and Cloud Administrator.

In this role I have the opportunity to be involved in all cloud related projects and expand my knowledge daily.
Currently the main focus is helping the company moving the infrastructure to Azure and work with developers to introduce some automation into the deployment strategies.
