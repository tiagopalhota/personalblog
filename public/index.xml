            How to troubleshoot Networking in Azure Functions Geez, what an experience this has been! It all started with an .NET azure function not being able to login into an on-premises SQL Server due to TLS negotiation. Now what?
In order to understand if the function is able to reach the on-premises server, I learned that we can get into the running container by ssh/bash whilst using the Kudu service. Kudu is the engine behind a number of features in Azure App Service .

            Replication is down!ðŸ˜Ÿ Now what?! This happened to us today, one of our subscribers, decided to implement a few triggers on their subscriptions. These triggers were inserting data into other tables that had a few foreign keys to respect their data integrity.
The problem here is that for some reason one of these foreign keys failed, the entire replication got brought to a halt. No more data is delivered until the replicated transaction can complete.

            Hi ðŸ‘‹ there! I guess this is it. I finally got a blog up and running.
IÂ´ve been told many times that blog helps our mind and the most important thing is to do it for ourselves, not others. This has been a massive issue for me because the web is full of great posts by great minds and I always thought I hadnÂ´t anything else to contribute. ðŸ˜•
The problem in this mindset is that I was thinking about others, not myself.
